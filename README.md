#  Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict stock prices based on historical market data. The focus is on time series forecasting, regression analysis, and performance evaluation using real stock market data.

## Project Requirements

**Skills Gained:**
- Time Series Analysis
- Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation and Validation

**Tools & Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for ML models and evaluation
- Keras (TensorFlow backend) for deep learning (LSTM)

**Dataset:**
- Historical stock prices from [Kaggle: Stock Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset)

# Final Deliverables:
- A trained predictive model that forecasts stock prices.
- Evaluation of model performance (MSE, RMSE, MAE).
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual prices.

# 2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, manually install:

pip install pandas scikit-learn keras matplotlib


# 3. Run Training Script
python train_model.py


# Output & Evaluation
After training:

The model predicts future stock prices based on historical trends.

Evaluation metrics are printed and stored.
